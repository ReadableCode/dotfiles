## Resolve Common Problems

### Git diff and git status don't show the updated files as changed

* To check for non-obviouse changes:

  ```bash
  git status -vvv
  ```

* Run the following command to fix the issue temporarily:

  ```bash
  git update-index --really-refresh
  ```

* To fix for a single file:

  ```bash
  git rm --cached <filename>
  git add <filename>
  git status
  ```

* To fix for all files:

  * **Warning**: Possibly destructive!
  
    ```bash
    git rm --cached -r .
    git add .
    git status
    ```

### Cannot pull because of changes locally but there are no changes locally

* **Warning**: Possibly destructive!

  ```bash
  git rm --cached -r .
  git reset --hard
  git pull
  ```
